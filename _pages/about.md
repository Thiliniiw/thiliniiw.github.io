<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.-->

<strong>🎯 I am on the job market for 2025-26, seeking Research Scientist positions in industry!</strong>
</div>

I am a PhD candidate at [`AI Institute, University of South Carolina`](https://aiisc.ai/index.html), specializing in the development and evaluation of language models with a focus on their analogy-making and abstraction capabilities.

🔬 I am fortunate to be advised by [`Dr. Amit Sheth`](https://amit.aiisc.ai/), and have closely collaborated with [`Dr. Amitava Das`](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HYpfhaEAAAAJ&hl=en), [`Dr. Valerie Shalin`](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?hl=en&user=trFx5GIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), and [`Dr. T. K. Prasad`](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Txz94twAAAAJ&hl=en).

💼 Previously, I completed a research internship at the [`National Library of Medicine (NLM)`](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/), under the supervision of [`Dr. Olivier Bodenreider`](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UsG8QFwAAAAJ&hl=en).

🎯 My research interests lie in language modeling, with a focus on the following areas:
- 🔎 Understanding how language models identify and generate analogies and abstractions
- 🪩 Leveraging structured knowledge to enhance model performance
- 🧠 Augmenting analogical reasoning capabilities through structured knowledge
- 🧩 Investigating the role of context in language modeling
