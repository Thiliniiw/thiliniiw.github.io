<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.-->
I am a PhD student at <a href='https://aiisc.ai/index.html'>AI Institute, University of South Carolina </a>, working on building and evaluating analogy-making and abstraction abilities of language models.

<a href='https://amit.aiisc.ai/'>Dr. Amit Sheth</a> is my advisor and I have closely worked with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HYpfhaEAAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr. Amitava Das</a>, <a href='https://scholar.google.fr/citations?hl=en&user=trFx5GIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate'>Dr. Valerie Shalin</a> and <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Txz94twAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate'>Dr. T. K. Prasad</a>.

Previously, I interned at <a href='https://www.nlm.nih.gov/'>NLM</a> under the supervision of <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UsG8QFwAAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr. Olivier Bodenreider</a> and <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GU60-gYAAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr. Vinh Nguyen</a>.

I am interested in language modeling, specifically in:
<ul>
  <li>How language models identify and generate analogies</li>
  <li>Building language models using structured knowledge sources</li>
  <li>Enhancing analogical reasoning in models with structured knowledge</li>
  <li>The role of context in language modeling</li>
</ul>
