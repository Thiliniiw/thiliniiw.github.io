I'm a **Ph.D. candidate** at the [AI Institute, University of South Carolina](https://aiisc.ai/index.html), passionate about advancing the capabilities of `language models`, particularly in the areas of `analogy-making` and `abstraction`.

🔬 I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Amit Sheth](https://amit.aiisc.ai/), and have closely collaborated with [Dr. Amitava Das](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HYpfhaEAAAAJ&hl=en), [Dr. Valerie Shalin](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?hl=en&user=trFx5GIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), and [Dr. T. K. Prasad](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Txz94twAAAAJ&hl=en).

💼 Previously, I completed a research internship at the [National Library of Medicine (NLM)](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/), under the supervision of [Dr. Olivier Bodenreider](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UsG8QFwAAAAJ&hl=en).

## 🎯 Research Interests

- 🔎 Understanding how `language models` **identify** and **generate** `analogies` and `abstractions`
- 📚 Leveraging `structured knowledge sources` to enhance model performance
- 🧠 Augmenting `analogical reasoning` capabilities through `structured knowledge`
- 🧩 Investigating the role of `context` in `language modeling`
