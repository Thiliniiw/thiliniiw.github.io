  abstract={Partial-to-full palmprint matching has attracted the experts in print identification area and researchers in palmprint matching. An efficient partial palmprint identification approach can increase the efficiency of the criminal investigation process in Sri Lanka as well as in other countries. This research investigates the existing researches done so far in order to achieve the challenges and limitations in palmprint matching. In this paper, the design of a segment based partial-to-full palmprint identification approach is presented which consists of three main modules: segment identification, hand type identification and minutiae matching.},

  abstract={The convenience of social media has also enabled its misuse, potentially resulting in toxic behavior. Nearly 66% of internet users have observed online harassment, and 41% claim personal experience, with 18% facing severe forms of online harassment. This toxic communication has a significant impact on the well-being of young individuals, affecting mental health and, in some cases, resulting in suicide. These communications exhibit complex linguistic and contextual characteristics, making recognition of such narratives challenging. In this paper, we provide a multimodal dataset of toxic social media interactions between confirmed high school students, called ALONE (AdoLescents ON twittEr), along with descriptive explanation. Each instance of interaction includes tweets, images, emoji and related metadata. Our observations show that individual tweets do not provide sufficient evidence for toxic behavior, and meaningful use of context in interactions can enable highlighting or exonerating tweets with purported toxicity.},

  abstract={The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus construction process mainly relies on lexical algorithms and manual expert curation for integrating over 200 biomedical vocabularies. A lexical-based learning model (LexLM) was developed to predict synonymy among Metathesaurus terms and largely outperforms a rule-based approach (RBA) that approximates the current construction process. However, the LexLM has the potential for being improved further because it only uses lexical information from the source vocabularies, while the RBA also takes advantage of contextual information. We investigate the role of multiple types of contextual information available to the UMLS editors, namely source synonymy (SS), source semantic group (SG), and source hierarchical relations (HR), for the UMLS vocabulary alignment (UVA) problem. In this paper, we develop multiple variants of context-enriched learning models (ConLMs) by adding to the LexLM the types of contextual information listed above. We represent these context types in context-enriched knowledge graphs (ConKGs) with four variants ConSS, ConSG, ConHR, and ConAll. We train these ConKG embeddings using seven KG embedding techniques. We create the ConLMs by concatenating the ConKG embedding vectors with the word embedding vectors from the LexLM. We evaluate the performance of the ConLMs using the UVA generalization test datasets with hundreds of millions of pairs. Our extensive experiments show a significant performance improvement from the ConLMs over the LexLM, namely +5.0% in precision (93.75%), +0.69% in recall (93.23%), +2.88% in F1 (93.49%) for the best ConLM. Our experiments also show that the ConAll variant including the three context types takes more time, but does not always perform better than other variants with a single context type. Finally, our experiments show that the pairs of terms with high lexical similarity benefit most from adding contextual information, namely +6.56% in precision (94.97%), +2.13% in recall (93.23%), +4.35% in F1 (94.09%) for the best ConLM. The pairs with lower degrees of lexical similarity also show performance improvement with +0.85% in F1 (96%) for low similarity and +1.31% in F1 (96.34%) for no similarity. These results demonstrate the importance of using contextual information in the UVA problem.},

  abstract={The UMLS Metathesaurus integrates more than 200 biomedical source vocabularies. During the Metathesaurus construction process, synonymous terms are clustered into concepts by human editors, assisted by lexical similarity algorithms. This process is error-prone and time-consuming. Recently, a deep learning model (LexLM) has been developed for the UMLS Vocabulary Alignment (UVA) task. This work introduces UBERT, a BERT-based language model, pretrained on UMLS terms via a supervised Synonymy Prediction (SP) task replacing the original Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) task. The effectiveness of UBERT for UMLS Metathesaurus construction process is evaluated using the UMLS Vocabulary Alignment (UVA) task. We show that UBERT outperforms the LexLM, as well as biomedical BERT-based models. Key to the performance of UBERT are the synonymy prediction task specifically developed for UBERT, the tight alignment of training data to the UVA task, and the similarity of the models used for pretrained UBERT.},

We evaluate the use of contextualized word embeddings extracted from nine different biomedical BERT-based models for synonym prediction in the UMLS by replacing BioWordVec embeddings with embeddings extracted from each biomedical BERT model using different feature extraction methods. Finally, we conduct a thorough grid search, which prior work lacks, to find the best set of hyperparameters. Surprisingly, we find that Siamese Networks initialized with BioWordVec embeddings still out perform the Siamese Networks initialized with embedding extracted from biomedical BERT model.",
