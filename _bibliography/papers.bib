  abstract={Partial-to-full palmprint matching has attracted the experts in print identification area and researchers in palmprint matching. An efficient partial palmprint identification approach can increase the efficiency of the criminal investigation process in Sri Lanka as well as in other countries. This research investigates the existing researches done so far in order to achieve the challenges and limitations in palmprint matching. In this paper, the design of a segment based partial-to-full palmprint identification approach is presented which consists of three main modules: segment identification, hand type identification and minutiae matching.},

  abstract={The convenience of social media has also enabled its misuse, potentially resulting in toxic behavior. Nearly 66% of internet users have observed online harassment, and 41% claim personal experience, with 18% facing severe forms of online harassment. This toxic communication has a significant impact on the well-being of young individuals, affecting mental health and, in some cases, resulting in suicide. These communications exhibit complex linguistic and contextual characteristics, making recognition of such narratives challenging. In this paper, we provide a multimodal dataset of toxic social media interactions between confirmed high school students, called ALONE (AdoLescents ON twittEr), along with descriptive explanation. Each instance of interaction includes tweets, images, emoji and related metadata. Our observations show that individual tweets do not provide sufficient evidence for toxic behavior, and meaningful use of context in interactions can enable highlighting or exonerating tweets with purported toxicity.},
